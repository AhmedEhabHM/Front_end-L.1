# Exercise: Basic HTML Structure

## Task 1: Create a Basic HTML Document
1. Open a text editor (e.g., VS Code or Notepad++).
2. Create a new file and save it as `index.html`.
3. Replicate the following structure in your file:
   - Use `<!DOCTYPE html>` to declare the document type.
   - Include `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.
   - Add a `<title>` in the `<head>` section.
   - Add a `<h1>` heading and a `<p>` paragraph in the `<body>` section.

---

## Task 2: Experiment with Attributes
1. Add a `<meta>` tag in the `<head>` section with the `charset` attribute set to `UTF-8`.
2. Include a `<link>` tag to an external stylesheet (you can just add the path `style.css` as a placeholder).
3. Inside the `<body>`, add:
   - A `<h2>` subheading with the text "About This Document."
   - A `<p>` paragraph describing your experience writing this HTML file.

---

## Bonus Task
1. Add a list (ordered or unordered) inside the `<body>` section with 3 items explaining what you learned.
2. Add a comment (`<!-- -->`) in your HTML code to describe each section (e.g., `<head>`, `<body>`).
