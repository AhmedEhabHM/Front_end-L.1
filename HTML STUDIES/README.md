#### **Example: 01_Syntax_and_Structure/**

**README.md**

```markdown
# 1. Syntax and Structure

Learn the foundational structure of an HTML document. This section covers the basic elements, their purpose, and how to structure a simple webpage.

## Topics Covered

1. **Basic HTML Document Structure**: Learn about the `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.
2. **Doctype Declaration**: Understand the importance of `<!DOCTYPE html>` in defining the HTML version.
3. **HTML Elements and Attributes**: Explore the components of HTML elements, including opening tags, closing tags, self-closing tags, and attributes.

---

## Example

See [example.html](example.html) for a demonstration of a basic HTML document structure.

## Exercise

Complete the tasks in [exercise.md](exercise.md) to build your first HTML webpage.

---

### Key Notes

- Always start your HTML document with `<!DOCTYPE html>` to ensure proper rendering.
- Use semantic and well-structured tags for clarity and maintainability.
- Indent nested elements for better readability.
```

**example.html**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Document Title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to HTML</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

**exercise.md**

```markdown
# Exercise - Syntax and Structure

### Task 1: Create a webpage with the following structure:
- Include a header with a title.
- Add a paragraph of text in the body section.
- Make sure your document starts with the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration.

### Task 2: Modify the page to include another heading (`<h2>`) and two more paragraphs.
```

---

#### **For Other Topics:**

For the rest of the topics (Headings and Paragraphs, Text Formatting, Comments, etc.), follow the same structure:
- A **README.md** that introduces the topic and lists key concepts.
- An **example.html** file to demonstrate how the concepts work.
- An **exercise.md** file with tasks for the user to practice.

Each folder will correspond to one HTML concept, and the structure will be consistent throughout the repository.
