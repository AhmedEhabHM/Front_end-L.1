# CSS Practical Assessment

### Task 1: Create a Simple Web Page

1. Create a simple HTML page with the following elements:
   - A header with a title
   - A navigation bar with at least three links
   - A main content area with two sections:
     - An introductory paragraph
     - A list of three items
   - A footer with your name

2. Style the page using CSS:
   - Set a background color for the body.
   - Style the header with a different background color and center the text.
   - Style the navigation bar to display horizontally and change the text color on hover.
   - Use margins and padding to space the elements nicely.
   - Apply a font style of your choice.

### Task 2: Responsive Design

1. Make the web page created in Task 1 responsive:
   - Use media queries to adjust the layout for mobile devices.
   - Ensure the navigation bar becomes a vertical list on smaller screens.
   - Adjust the font sizes for better readability on mobile devices.

### Task 3: CSS Grid Layout

1. Create a new HTML page that demonstrates the CSS Grid layout:
   - Set up a grid container with at least three columns.
   - Place different elements (like images, text, or divs) into the grid cells.
   - Use CSS to style the grid:
     - Add borders and padding to the grid items.
     - Set different background colors for each grid item.

### Task 4: CSS Animation

1. Add animation to one of the elements from your previous tasks:
   - Choose an element (e.g., a button, a header, or an image).
   - Create a CSS animation that changes the element's size or color when hovered over.
   - Ensure that the animation is smooth and visually appealing.
